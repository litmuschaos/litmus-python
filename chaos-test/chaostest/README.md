## Steps to install Chaos Toolkit

Install Python for your system:

1. On MacOS X:
   ```
   $ brew install python3
   ```

1. On Debian/Ubuntu:
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv
   ```

1. On CentOS:
   ```
   $ sudo yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
   $ sudo yum -y install python35u
   ```
   > **Note:**, on CentOS, the Python 3.5 binary is named python3.5 rather than python3 as other systems.

# Build Manually

   Dependencies can be installed for your system via its package management but, more likely, you will want to install them yourself in a local virtual environment.
1.
   ```
   $ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/chaostk
   ```

1. Make sure to always activate your virtual environment before using it:

   ```
   $ source  ~/.venvs/chaostk/bin/activate
   ```

# Install chaostest CLI

1. Install chaostest in the virtual environment as follows:
   ```
   (chaostk) $ pip install chaostoolkit

1. You can verify the command was installed by running:
   ```
   (chaostk) $ chaos --version
   ```
